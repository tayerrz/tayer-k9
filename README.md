**Description :spiral_notepad:  :** 

:wave:  Hey guys, I've always wanted to Roleplay as a police officer with a K9, unfortunately, I never found **THE** script that has no bugs, and is easy to use and for **free** ! So I decided to make my own script, and here it is !
(note that some functions were inspired by other scripts, but I tried to make it as much as possible as standalone as possible)

**Usage :hammer_and_wrench: :**

To use the resource, download it, put the `tayer-K9` folder in your main resources folder.
Add `start tayer-K9` to your server.cfg
Then, once you're in game, press O to toggle the menu.

**Features :sparkles: :**

* STANDALONE : this means that you don't need any dependencies to start this script on your server
* Easy to use
* Give your K9 a name
* Multiple animations for your K9
* Attack a target (you can choose between the K9 attacking the player in front of him, or the player you're selecting)
* The K9 can follow you, or stay in a specific place
* The K9 can be called back to you
* The K9 can be put in the car
* The K9 can bark


*Demo :eyes:  :*
